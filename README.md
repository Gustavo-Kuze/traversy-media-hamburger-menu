# Traversy Media's Hamburger Menu
A React Component based on Traversy Media's Hamburger menu &amp; overlay


**NOTE**: I made this package for fun and I'm not aiming to use It in any real projects. All credits related to the animations and styles in general go to Brad Traversy for his original tutorial, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZg6UfS5zYg&t=954s).

## Usage
1. Install the package:
`npm i --save traversy-media-hamburger-menu`
or
`yarn add traversy-media-hamburger-menu`
